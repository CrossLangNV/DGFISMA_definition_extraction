Under Regulation ATS, an entity that falls within the definition of an exchange must register either as a NSE or as a broker-dealer and comply with Regulation ATS. An ATS must operate a multilateral system where participants execute transactions in accordance with non-discretionary rules. ATSs that account for 5 % or more of the average daily trading volume within a certain time period in any equity security must comply with the fair access requirements of Section 242.301(b)(5)(ii) of the Regulation ATS. Specifically, they must establish written standards for granting access to trading in the relevant security on their systems and maintain these standards in their records. An ATS is prohibited from unreasonably restricting or limiting any persons with respect to access to its services for those equity securities for which the ATS accounts for 5 % or more of the average daily trading volume in the applicable time period, and must not apply these standards in an unfair or discriminatory manner. The access standards are provided to the SEC upon request.\n",

      "To ensure the liquidity and profitability of SME growth markets, Article 33(3)(a) of Directive 2014/65/EU requires that at least 50 % of the issuers whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on an SME growth market are SMEs issuing equity and/or debt securities. Under Directive 2014/65/EU, SME equity issuers are defined as a company that had an average market capitalisation of less than EUR 200 million on the basis of the end-year quotes for the previous three calendars years. On the other hand, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 (2) provides that a non-equity (debt-only) SME issuer should meet at least two of the three following conditions: (i) the number of employees (less than 250); (ii) the total balance sheet (less than EUR 43 million); and (iii) the annual net turnover (less than EUR 50 million). This requirement for a non-equity issuer to qualify as an SME has been found to be too restrictive because such issuers tend to be larger than traditional SMEs. As a result, many non-equity issuers cannot qualify as SMEs under Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565, despite remaining relatively small. As they cannot meet the 50 % threshold of issuers qualifying as SMEs, many MTFs specialised in SME debt issuances or allowing both bond and shares issuances cannot register as SME growth markets. In turn, if operators of MTFs do not make use of SME growth markets framework, issuers on those MTFs cannot benefit from the lighter regulatory requirements foreseen to foster listings and issuances on these SME growth markets. In order to enable more MTFs to register as SME growth markets, the nominal value of an issuer's debt issuances (excluding loans) over the previous calendar year should therefore be laid down as the sole criterion for qualifying non-equity issuers as SMEs for the purposes of SME growth markets. The Commission will monitor the effectiveness of the new definition of non-equity SME issuer in enabling MTFs to register as SME growth markets and its impact on market developments and investor confidence.\n",

      "Where an over-the-counter (OTC) contract is valued on the same underlying commodity that is deliverable at the same location and with the same contractual conditions and if it is having a highly correlated economic outcome to a contract traded on a trading venue, it should be deemed economically equivalent regardless of small differences in the contractual specifications concerning the lot sizes and the date of delivery. Also differences in post trade risk management arrangements, such as clearing arrangements, should not be barriers to declaring such contracts as economically equivalent. In order to prevent inappropriate netting of potentially dominant positions traded on a trading venue by the use of bilateral arrangements in OTC contracts and to ensure an efficient operation of the position limits regime in practice it is necessary for commodity derivatives traded OTC to be considered economically equivalent to trading venue contracts only in limited circumstances. To deter avoidance of position limits and to enhance the integrity of the position limit regime it is necessary that a definition of an economically equivalent OTC contract is narrowly framed so that it does not permit a person to net an OTC position against multiple other positions or to exercise discretion in the choice of positions against which it is netted.\n",

      "The standard baseline of 25 % of deliverable supply and of open interest has been set with reference to the experience of other markets and other jurisdictions. The baseline should be adjusted by competent authorities to enable it to be reduced by a maximum of 20 % (or 22,5 % in the case of some agricultural commodity derivatives) and to be increased by a maximum of 10 % (or 15 % in the case of less liquid commodity derivatives) should the characteristics of the market require it, such as an absence of market participants, in order to support the orderly settlement and functioning of the contract and its underlying market. Since any adjustment to the baseline figure applies only where, and for so long as, objective characteristics of the market require it, temporary adjustments to the baseline should be therefore possible. Competent authorities should ensure that an adjustment downwards of the baseline is effected whenever it is necessary to prevent dominant positions and to support orderly pricing in the commodity derivative and in the underlying commodity. The range reflects that Directive 2014/65/EU covers a wider range of commodity derivatives and markets than other markets and jurisdictions. The definition of commodity derivative under Article 2(1)(30) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) is broad, comprising also securitised derivatives and cash settled derivatives which do not have a tangible underlying such as climatic variables. For securitised derivatives the concept of spot and other months' does not apply. For derivatives without a tangible underlying the deliverable supply cannot be used to establish a position limit. Therefore competent authorities should be able to enhance or adjust the methodologies to determine position limits for these commodity derivatives based on different parameters like number of securities issued or the use of open interest also for the spot month.\n",

That proposal includes the establishment of the InvestEU Advisory Hub that should support the development of a robust pipeline of investment projects and the InvestEU Portal that should provide investors with an easily accessible and user-friendly database of investment projects. InvestEU will thereby support investments in finance for small and medium-sized businesses in the form of bonds, loans or private equity as well as other long-term investments in equity. The standard formula for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement does not provide for specific rules for investments in privately placed debt, private equity and long-term investments in equity. In light of the expected improvement in the accessibility of such investments by means of the InvestEU portal, such specific rules should be introduced. In addition, in light of the Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union of 30 September 2015, more investments in Europe should be encouraged and access to equity and debt funding for European small and medium-sized enterprises should be facilitated. The prudential treatment of private equity and privately placed debt should therefore be amended to remove unjustified barriers to investments in those asset classes.\n",

Not all insurance and reinsurance undertakings have the information on risk zone level required for that calculation in their internal systems, and for those undertakings it may be costly to produce this information. Those undertakings should therefore be able to base their calculation on groupings of risk zones where such grouping is well substantiated and proportionate to the exposure.\n",

Insurance and reinsurance undertakings using the standard formula for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement for counterparty default risk should therefore be able to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement for counterparty default risk on the basis of the assumption that more than 60 % of the counterparty's assets are subject to collateral arrangements.\n",

Disproportionate burden when calculating that requirement should be avoided.

The standard formula should also allow for netting arrangements between derivatives and hedging strategies where several contractual arrangements together have the effect of a risk mitigation technique. Possible deviations between the risk mitigating effect reflected in the standard formula on the one hand and the actual risk mitigation effect on the other, and an assessment of basis risk, should be included in the undertakings own risk and solvency assessment.\n",

That Regulation contains criteria to determine whether a securitisation can be designated as a simple, transparent and standardised (‘STS’) securitisation. Since those criteria ensure that STS securitisations are of high quality, they should also be used to determine which securitisations are to count as high quality liquid assets for the calculation of the liquidity coverage requirement. Securitisations should therefore be eligible as level 2B assets for the purposes of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 if they fulfil all the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/2402, in addition to those criteria already specified in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 that are specific to their liquidity characteristics.\n",

Transactions with the ECB or the central bank of a Member State can be expected to be rolled-over under conditions of severe stress. It should therefore be possible for competent authorities to waive the unwind mechanism for the calculation of the liquidity buffer in the case of secured transactions with the ECB or the central bank of a Member State where the transactions involve high quality liquid assets on at least one leg of each transaction and are due to mature within the next 30 calendar days. However, before granting the waiver, competent authorities should be required to consult with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction, and also with the ECB if that central bank is an Eurosystem central bank. In addition, the waiver should be subject to appropriate safeguards in order to avoid possible regulatory arbitrage opportunities or adverse incentives for credit institutions. Finally, to align the Union rules more closely with the international standard set by the BCBS, collateral received through derivatives transactions should be removed from the unwind mechanism.\n",

      "Pursuant to Article 65(3) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 the Board is to determine and raise contributions as well as to ensure that they are fully and timely paid. In order to enable the Board to meet those requirements, an efficient system for raising the administrative contributions from the institutions and entities referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 should be ensured. Those institutions and entities are already subject to numerous reporting obligations set out in Union legislation. More specifically, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1163/2014 of the European Central Bank (3), the ECB collects data on total assets and total risk exposure for the purposes of calculating supervisory fees. The data collected in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1163/2014 can be meaningfully used for the calculation of the administrative contributions to the Board. Pursuant to Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, the Board and the ECB are to cooperate closely in the exercise of their respective responsibilities under that Regulation and, in particular, provide each other with all the information necessary for the performance of their tasks. It is more efficient to request the ECB to transmit data it received and verified in the exercise of its tasks and powers conferred on it by Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (4) to the Board, than to duplicate the reporting burden for the institutions and entities concerned. Data sharing between the ECB and the Board would also allow avoiding duplication of the data verification process by the Board and builds on the obligation of the Board and the ECB to cooperate closely in the exercise of their respective responsibilities under Regulation (EU) No 806/2014. Any duplication of the data reporting and verification processes would inevitably require more time for the calculation and raising of contributions and would lead to a less efficient system. It follows that, as a part of the cooperation obligation, the ECB should be required to transmit to the Board the data received from the institutions and entities concerned for the purpose of calculating contributions to the Board. The Board should rely to the greatest extent possible on the data collected by the ECB.

Such a requirement should apply as regards errors that occur because the Board applies incorrectly the methodology for calculating the individual annual contributions.

On the contrary, cases where the input data used in the calculation of individual annual contributions is not correct or is subject to a change after the calculation was performed should not be considered errors in the calculation and should therefore be treated differently.

The value of the financial instruments underlying the transaction should also be the basis for the calculation of the level of cash penalty where the settlement fail is due to a lack of cash. The level of cash penalties should provide incentives to failing participants to promptly settle transactions that failed to be settled. In order to ensure the effective achievement of the objectives pursued by the imposition of cash penalties, the adequacy of the parameters for their calculation should be monitored on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as necessary, on the basis of the impact of those penalties on the market.\n",

For the same reasons, custody risk for securities held through a link with another CSD should not be subject to any additional regulatory capital charge but should be considered as part of the regulatory capital for operational risk.

      "The Commission proposal for a new Regulation establishing the InvestEU Programme (2) focusses on addressing EU-wide market failures and sub-optimal investment situations. That proposal includes the establishment of the InvestEU Advisory Hub that should support the development of a robust pipeline of investment projects and the InvestEU Portal that should provide investors with an easily accessible and user-friendly database of investment projects. InvestEU will thereby support investments in finance for small and medium-sized businesses in the form of bonds, loans or private equity as well as other long-term investments in equity. The standard formula for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement does not provide for specific rules for investments in privately placed debt, private equity and long-term investments in equity. In light of the expected improvement in the accessibility of such investments by means of the InvestEU portal, such specific rules should be introduced. In addition, in light of the Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union of 30 September 2015, more investments in Europe should be encouraged and access to equity and debt funding for European small and medium-sized enterprises should be facilitated. The prudential treatment of private equity and privately placed debt should therefore be amended to remove unjustified barriers to investments in those asset classes.\n",

      "\n",
      "The standard formula calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement for counterparty default risk requires insurance and reinsurance undertakings to take into account the share of the counterparty's assets that are subject to collateral arrangements. A disproportionate burden in the calculation with the standard formula should be avoided. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings using the standard formula for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement for counterparty default risk should therefore be able to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement for counterparty default risk on the basis of the assumption that more than 60 % of the counterparty's assets are subject to collateral arrangements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Insurance and reinsurance undertakings using the standard formula for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement for counterparty default risk have to use a specific formula for the calculation of the capital requirement for counterparty default risk on type 1 exposures where the standard deviation of the loss distribution of type 1 exposures is lower than 7 %. Disproportionate burden when calculating that requirement should be avoided. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings should therefore be able to calculate the capital requirement for counterparty default risk on type 1 exposures using the same formula that is applied where the standard deviation of the loss distribution for type 1 exposures is between 7 % and 20 %.\n",

      "As laid down in the margin rules of Japan, financial institutions which have an average total amount of notional principal of OTC derivatives for a certain period of time equal to or above JPY 300 billion must exchange variation margin on a daily basis under the FIEA, while financial institutions below that threshold must exchange variation margin with ‘a sufficient frequency’. Because Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 requires all counterparties to an OTC derivative transaction not cleared by a CCP to exchange variation margin on a daily basis, this Decision should therefore be conditional on the daily exchange of variation margin for transactions conducted with FIBOs and RFIs whose average total amount of the notional principal of OTC derivatives for a one-year period, from April two years before the year in which calculation is required (or one year if calculated in December) falls below JPY 300 billion.\n",

      "The legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements applicable in the USA for OTC derivative contracts are laid down in title VII of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (‘Dodd-Frank Act’) and in the specific implementing rules adopted by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (‘CFTC Regulations’). The Dodd-Frank Act, which entered into force in July 2010, established a new regulatory framework for certain OTC derivatives defined as swaps in section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act (‘CEA’), aiming at reducing systemic risk, increasing transparency and promoting market integrity within the financial system. The CFTC has jurisdiction over swaps and most of the operative provisions of title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act became applicable in 2011.\n",

      "The requirements of the final margin rule apply to swaps, which encompass almost all contracts defined as OTC derivatives in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 with the exception of foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps, for which the final margin rule sets no requirements. In addition, CFTC Regulations do not contain any specific treatment for structured products including covered bonds and securitisations. In the Union, foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards are exempted from the initial margins requirements, and derivatives associated with covered bonds for hedging purposes may also be exempted from initial margin requirements. This Decision should therefore only apply to OTC derivatives that are subject to margins under both the Union law and the CFTC Regulations.\n",

      "To ensure the liquidity and profitability of SME growth markets, Article 33(3)(a) of Directive 2014/65/EU requires that at least 50 % of the issuers whose financial instruments are admitted to trading on an SME growth market are SMEs issuing equity and/or debt securities. Under Directive 2014/65/EU, SME equity issuers are defined as a company that had an average market capitalisation of less than EUR 200 million on the basis of the end-year quotes for the previous three calendars years. On the other hand, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 (2) provides that a non-equity (debt-only) SME issuer should meet at least two of the three following conditions: (i) the number of employees (less than 250); (ii) the total balance sheet (less than EUR 43 million); and (iii) the annual net turnover (less than EUR 50 million). This requirement for a non-equity issuer to qualify as an SME has been found to be too restrictive because such issuers tend to be larger than traditional SMEs. As a result, many non-equity issuers cannot qualify as SMEs under Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565, despite remaining relatively small. As they cannot meet the 50 % threshold of issuers qualifying as SMEs, many MTFs specialised in SME debt issuances or allowing both bond and shares issuances cannot register as SME growth markets. In turn, if operators of MTFs do not make use of SME growth markets framework, issuers on those MTFs cannot benefit from the lighter regulatory requirements foreseen to foster listings and issuances on these SME growth markets. In order to enable more MTFs to register as SME growth markets, the nominal value of an issuer's debt issuances (excluding loans) over the previous calendar year should therefore be laid down as the sole criterion for qualifying non-equity issuers as SMEs for the purposes of SME growth markets. The Commission will monitor the effectiveness of the new definition of non-equity SME issuer in enabling MTFs to register as SME growth markets and its impact on market developments and investor confidence.\n",

Consistent with this requirement, all DCMs utilize central limit order books in which bids and offers are shown. Additionally, DCMs post price quote information on their public websites. SEF transactions involving swaps that are subject to the CFTC's trade execution requirement, which are not block trades, must be executed either in accordance with an Order Book, as defined in the CFTC regulations, or in accordance with a Request-for-Quote System that operates in conjunction with an Order Book. A ‘Request-for-Quote System’ is defined in the CFTC regulations as a trading system or platform in which a market participant transmits a request for a quote to buy or sell a specific instrument to no less than three market participants in the trading system or platform, to which all such market participants may respond. Furthermore, Part 43 of the CFTC's regulations requires a publicly reportable swap transaction to be reported to a CFTC-registered swap data repository (SDR) as soon as technologically practicable after the transaction is executed. For a publicly reportable swap transaction that is executed on or pursuant to the rules of a DCM or SEF, the SDR must ensure that swap transaction and pricing data is publicly disseminated as soon as technologically practicable after such data is received from the DCM or SEF, unless the swap is subject to a time delay. An SDR is required to delay public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data for publicly reportable swap transactions that exceed certain sizes.\n",

A covered counterparty is a counterparty that is a financial end user with material swaps exposure or a swap entity that enters into a swap with a covered swap entity. According to section 23.150 of the CFTC Regulations, the material swaps exposure is an average daily notional value of non-cleared OTC derivatives that exceeds USD 8 billion (8 000 million), whereas the analogous threshold set out in Article 28 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 (3) is EUR 8 billion (8 000 million). In the Union, the requirement to exchange variation margin does not have a materiality threshold, and applies to all counterparties subject to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. The CFTC Regulations for combined minimum transfer amount of initial and variation margin in the final margin rule is USD 500 000, whereas the related requirement set out in Article 25 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 is EUR 500 000.

      "The parameters for calculating cash penalties should be adapted to the specificities of certain trading venues, such as SME growth markets as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). Cash penalties for settlement fails should not hinder access by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to capital markets as an alternative to bank lending. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 allows SME growth markets the flexibility not to apply the buy-in process to settlement fails until up to 15 days after the intended settlement date. Consequently, cash penalties for settlement fails in financial instruments traded on SME growth markets may apply during a longer period of time than for other financial instruments. Given the length of application of cash penalties, lower liquidity and specificities of SME growth markets, the penalty rate for settlement fails of transactions in financial instruments traded on such trading venues should be set at a specific rate that should provide incentives for timely settlement but should not affect their smooth and orderly functioning. It is also appropriate to ensure that settlement fails of transactions in certain financial instruments, such as debt instruments traded on such venues, are subject to a lower penalty rate than similar debt instruments traded on other markets.\n",

Furthermore, Part 43 of the CFTC's regulations requires a publicly reportable swap transaction to be reported to a CFTC-registered swap data repository (SDR) as soon as technologically practicable after the transaction is executed. For a publicly reportable swap transaction that is executed on or pursuant to the rules of a DCM or SEF, the SDR must ensure that swap transaction and pricing data is publicly disseminated as soon as technologically practicable after such data is received from the DCM or SEF, unless the swap is subject to a time delay.
